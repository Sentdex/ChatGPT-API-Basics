    "There has been a ChatGPT implementation where you can chat with ChatGPT extremely easily, so why might we be interested in an API instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the API just plain gives you far more power and control to do more new and novel things with ChatGPT's responses, as well as the ability to integrate it with other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to query this model, we will first need an API key. For this, you'll need an account and to set up billing. Typically, you will get some starting credit, but you may or may not, depending on when you sign up and try to use this API. You can create your account at https://platform.openai.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, go to the top right, click your profile, manage account, and then billing to add a payment method. From here, on the left side, choose API Keys under \"user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a key, and then copy the key's value, you will need this in your program. In the same directory that you're working in, create a \"key.txt\" file and copy and paste the key in there. Save and exit. This particular API costs $0.002, or a fifth of a penny, per 1,000 tokens at the time of my writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need the `openai` Python package. You can install it with `pip install --upgrade openai`. The upgrade is there to ensure that you have the latest version, since the ChatGPT API is a new feature."

    "Keep in mind, however that the maximum context length is 4096 tokens, so you need to stay under that. There are lots of options to work around this, the simplest being truncating earlier messages, but you can actually even use ChatGPT to help you to summarize and condense the previous message history. Maybe more on this later though. 4096 tokens is something like 20,000 characters, but it this can vary. Tokens are just words, bits of words, or combinations of words or cominations of bits of words.
