    "This task of structuring and getting deterministic outputs from a language model has so far been a very difficult task, and has been the subject of much research. Usually the approach is to keep trying various pre-prompts and few shot learning examples until you find one that at least works. While doable, the end result was clunky and not very reliable. Now though, you can use the function calling capability to build out quite powerful programs. Essentially, adding intelligence to your programs.\n",
