# Unlimited chatbot using chatGPT API

## Introduction
This is a simple chatbot that uses the chatGPT API to generate unlimited responses such as NSFW content. The chatGPT API is a paid service, so you need to get your own API key to use this chatbot. The UI is built using Gradio.


## Usage
    1. add your chatGPT API key to `authkey.txt`
    2. comment out line 5 and uncomment line 6 in `chatbot.py` to use the chatGPT API
    3. run the following commands
        ```shell
        $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        $ python3 chatbot.py
        ```
    4. chat with the bot on browser
